Processing:
The features, activities, and subjects are read for the train and test subjects. The activitylabels are also read in to provide a readable 
description for the activities. Of the 561 features, only 66 are mean and std dev related features. They are identified by mean() and std()
in their names. They are identified by regular expression but taking care to ignore other instances of mean like meanFreq.

Specific Steps: (features and variables will be used interchangeably)
1)  Create the working directory, if needed. The default working directory is "./data". Set the working directory.
2)  Download the zip file from the url given in the assignment.
3)  Unzip the zip file.
4)  Ensure that the needed files for processing exist.
5)  Read features file. This is the list of features with their names that gives an idea of whether they are means, std deviations.
    Fix minor typos where Body is replicated.
6)  Get a list of needed variables (mean, std) - indicated by mean(), std(). Please note that the paranthesis symbol has to be escaped.
7)  Clean the variable names - remove dashes, paranthesis, convert to lowercase.
8)  Read the activity descriptions.
9)  Read test data set - features, activity, subject.
10) Merge test activity data with activity descriptions.
11) Combine features, activity, subject by using cbind() function.
12) Repeat steps 9-11 for train data.
13) Combine test and train data by using rbind() function.
14) The subject column is integer - change it to a factor.
15) Write out the combined test and train data.
16) Group the combined test and train data by activity description and subject.
17) Summarize the mean for each variable by using summarize_each() function.
18) Output the summarized dataset.

Note:
Additional tests could be conducted which ensure that all the normalized values are within -1 and 1.
All the features are normalized values and therefore do not have any units.
